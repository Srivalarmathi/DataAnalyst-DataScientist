Overview
FitWell Analytics harnesses data from wearable fitness devices to perform an in-depth analysis of individual fitness and wellness metrics. The project employs a variety of analytical techniques to offer a comprehensive view of user activity, illuminate key relationships between different fitness metrics, and assess the performance of fitness tracking devices.

Objectives
Predictive Modeling:

Develop and refine linear regression models to predict heart rate based on various fitness metrics.

Correlation Analysis:

Identify and understand the relationships and dependencies between different fitness metrics.

Distribution Analysis:

Analyze and visualize the distribution of various fitness metrics to identify patterns and outliers.

Drillthrough Analysis:

Perform detailed activity and member-specific analysis to provide personalized fitness insights and recommendations.

Device Performance Evaluation:

Assess the accuracy and reliability of different fitness tracking devices to ensure high-quality data capture.

Comprehensive Reporting:

Generate detailed reports and visualizations that communicate key findings and actionable insights.

Data
Source: Wearable fitness devices (e.g., smartwatches, fitness bands).

Format: CSV files containing the following columns:

Personal Information: Age, gender, height, weight.

Activity Metrics: Steps, heart rate, distance, entropy of heart rate, entropy of steps, resting heart rate, correlation between heart rate and steps, normalized heart rate, intensity using Karvonen formula, standard deviation of normalized heart rate, steps times distance.

Target Variable: heart_rate.

Analysis
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values, standardizing and normalizing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducting descriptive statistics and visualizing data distributions.

Predictive Modeling:

Developing linear regression models for calorie prediction.

Correlation and Distribution Analysis:

Calculating and visualizing Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation matrices.

Analyzing distributions with histograms and scatter plots.

Drillthrough Analysis:

Detailed analysis by activity ID and member ID for personalized insights.

Device Performance Analysis:

Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of different fitness tracking devices.
